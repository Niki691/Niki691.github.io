I am Niklas-Kim Laerum, 25 years old and have been a research assistant at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.bwl.uni-hamburg.de/harcis/01-zentrum/01-team/researcher/niklas-kim-laerum.html) since 2024. Before that, I worked as a Junior Researcher at Universit√§t Hamburg from 2020-2024.

From 2018 to 2024 I did both my Bachelor (Computer Science) and my Master (Industrial Informatics) at the [University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer](https://www.hs-emden-leer.de/). I am currently doing research in the field of process mining and supervise theses, projects and support courses.
